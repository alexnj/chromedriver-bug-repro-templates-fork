# Template for macOS, Selenium, MochaJS

This repository serves as a boilerplate for reproducing ChromeDriver regressions
across platforms using Selenium WebDriver and MochaJS on macOS.

## Your Goal

To use this template, extend the test case in `test.js` with steps that 
demonstrate the issue you are investigating. Your aim should be to create
a reproducible, minimal test case.

## Overview

The test script (`test.js`) performs the following actions:

1.  **Environment Setup**: Automatically downloads a specific version of Chrome
    (Canary by default) and the matching ChromeDriver binary into a local `.cache`
    directory using `@puppeteer/browsers`.
2.  **WebDriver Initialization**: Configures Selenium to use the downloaded binaries
    explicitly, ensuring version compatibility.
3.  **Test Execution**:
    - The sample test navigates to `https://www.google.com`. You can modify this
      test to add your specific reproduction steps.

## For local testing

- Have the appropriate version of Node.js installed.
- Install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- To run the tests with the default configuration (latest Chrome Canary):
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Customizing the Test

Open `test.js` and modify the provided test block to include the steps required to
reproduce your specific issue.

```javascript
it('ISSUE REPRODUCTION', async function () {
  // Add test reproducing the issue here.
  await driver.get('https://example.com');
  // ... assertions and interactions
});
```

## GitHub Actions

The included GitHub Actions workflow in
`.github/workflows/macos-selenium-mochajs.yml` will automatically run the tests on
every push and pull request.

## Automating Triage with Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI can be used to automate the bug triaging process using the template
defined in GEMINI.md.
